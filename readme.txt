Creates a log in page at /login/ and manages password recovery and user notification feedback for the log in process.

== Description ==

Creates a log in page at /login/ and manages password recovery and user notification feedback for the log in process. Everything gets managed within your page.php template or page-login.php template in order to fit into the theme better.

By default, this plugin creates a virtual page, but if you add a page with slug 'login', the plugin will begin to use that.

= Add a redirect for logged in users =

Controls where logged in users go when they login or when they visit the '/login/' page. You can either return the post_id of the post/page to send them to, or the slug of the post/page to send them to.

`
// Redirect using post id
add_filter( 'sewn/login/logged_in_redirect', 'custom_sewn_logged_in_redirect_id' );
function custom_sewn_logged_in_redirect_id()
{
	return 4;
}
`

`
// Redirect using post slug
add_filter( 'sewn/login/logged_in_redirect', 'custom_sewn_logged_in_redirect_slug' );
function custom_sewn_logged_in_redirect_slug()
{
	return 'post-slug';
}
`
